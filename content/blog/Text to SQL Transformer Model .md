challenge: SQL plays a crucial role in data-driven businesses, but mastering it can be challenging for many individuals. What if there was a solution that allowed users to write SQL queries using natural language, enabling them to easily retrieve the data?

solution: Develop a Text-to-SQL model using Transformer architecture to generate relevant SQL queries based on user prompts. Due to limited resources, an 11M-parameter model was trained for 1500 steps over 24 hours, achieving a checkpoint loss of 4.26. Further resource allocation can optimize the model for improved coherence in generating responses.

shortDescription: The emergence of ChatGPT has ushered in a new era in Artificial Intelligence. This project focuses on learning and constructing a Text-to-SQL model utilizing the Transformer architecture. This powerful deep learning model has gained recognition for its exceptional performance in various natural language processing tasks. The objective is to develop a PyTorch-based model that can comprehend natural language and generate SQL queries. To accomplish this, Andrej Karpathy's tutorial and base code were employed as valuable resources for project development.
